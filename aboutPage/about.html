        <p class="descr">
            Salvador Dalí was born in Figueres, Catalonia Spain on May 11th, 1904.
            He was influenced early by classical masters, and was formally trained at the San 
            Fernando Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Madrid. 
        </p>
        <p class="descr">
            As his skills started to progress he became more interested in avant-garde
            and cubist art. By the late 1920's, after a trip to Paris where he met with Picasso, whom 
            he highly regarded, he started to develop his own style and create surrealist paintings. 
            His classical training shines through as it jarringly juxtaposes absurdist scenes.
        </p>
        <p class="descr">
            In 1929, Dalí formally joined the surrealist movement. He is best known for his paintings, 
            but he also helped to create the film 'Le Chien Andalou' with Andre Brenton, as well as 
            making strange objects like telephones with lobsters for receivers. His most famous work is 
            'The Persistence of Memory', created in 1931. 
        </p>
        <p class="descr">
            The majority of his major work can be found at the Dalí Theatre-Museum in Figueres, and the 
            Salvador Dalí Museum in St Petersburg, Florida.
